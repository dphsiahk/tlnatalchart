TL Natal Chart is a web based numerology & natal profile tool. You input your birth data (date, name, etc.) and it generates several numerological readings:
•	Sun Sign, Life Path Number, Expression Number (based on your name)
•	Soul Urge Number (vowels in your name) and Personality Number (consonants)
•	A “Core Profile”, “Power & Strength”, “Spiritual Analytics” and “Advanced Motivations & Journey Map” section.
(tlnatalchart.netlify.app)
•	It also supports different cultural lenses (Global, Liberia, West African, Other African) for the interpretation of results. (tlnatalchart.netlify.app)

Key features
•	It’s built using a “local first” approach: user profiles, data and calculations are stored locally (in your browser) rather than relying on external APIs. (tlnatalchart.netlify.app)
•	You can “Save to Profile”, “Export JSON”, “Print” results, or “Request 1 on 1 Spiritual Support”. (tlnatalchart.netlify.app)
•	Simple, clean UI (built with Tailwind CSS per the source) and minimal external dependencies. (tlnatalchart.netlify.app)

Who it’s for / Use Case
•	If you’re interested in numerology (birth date & name based), natal profiling, or combining this with cultural perspectives (especially Liberian / West African), this tool gives you a quick self readout.
•	It could be useful for spiritual wellness contexts, self discovery exercises, or as a supporting resource in courses or workshops related to personal/spiritual development.

Things to keep in mind
•	It is numerology based, not mainstream astrology or astronomical natal charting – so its outputs are interpretive rather than empirical.
•	Being local first means your data stays on your device (good for privacy) but you’ll want to back up anything important yourself (via export).
•	The cultural lens option is unique, but as always with interpretive tools: reflect critically and use it as a guide, not a fixed truth.
•	If you integrate this into courses or teachings, it might serve best as a supplementary tool (e.g., personal exploration) rather than primary academic content.
